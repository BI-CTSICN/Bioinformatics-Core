The Children's National Informatics Core brings together Bioinformatics and Biomedical Informatics to both conduct novel research.

- We provides an array of clinical and biomedical research data analysis services. 
- We assist users to design Clinical Trails and Resraech Designs
- Our Bioinformatics unit assists in analysis of high throughput next generation sequencing data. Also study design, s
ample size and power calculation, data analysis and planning, manuscript section writing, data management, 
grant writing support, data quality control, and support with software tools.

- Our Biomedical informatics core provides support Since its inception, the Informatics Core has 
provided investigators with expertise and resources related to database management through cutting-edge technology and 
special applications. It enables new investigators who are without access to sophisticated computer capabilities 
and/or personnel to devise an efficient, integrated data management system in anticipation of data collection. 
he availability of knowledgeable informatics staff greatly facilitates data management for these individuals.
