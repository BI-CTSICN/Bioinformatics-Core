Informatics is the science of how to use data, information and knowledge to improve human health and the delivery of health care services. Biomedical and health informatics applies principles of computer and information science to the advancement of life sciences research, health professions education, public health, and patient care. This multidisciplinary and integrative field focuses on health information technologies (HIT), and involves the computer, cognitive, and social sciences. **- AMIA**


At Children's National, the Informatics Core brings together Bioinformatics and Biomedical Informatics to conduct novel research. We provides an array of clinical and biomedical research data analysis services, including support for designing Clinical Trails and Research Experiments

- Along with analysis of high throughput next generation sequencing data, our **Bioinformatics Unit** also assists in experimental study design and planning, manuscript section writing/grant writing support, data quality control and management and support with software tools. Please go to <https://bi-ctsicn.github.io/CBU/> for more information.

- Our **Biomedical Informatics** core  provided investigators with expertise in clinical data management and analysis. Please go to <https://childrensnational.org/research-and-education/research-resources/biomedical-informatics> for more information.
