The Children's National Informatics Core brings together Bioinformatics and Biomedical Informatics to both conduct novel research.

- We provides an array of clinical and biomedical research data analysis services, including support for designing Clinical Trails and Research Experiments
- Along with analysis of high throughput next generation sequencing data, our Bioinformatics unit also assists in experimental study design and planning, manuscript section writing/grant writing support, data quality control and management and support with software tools. Please go to <https://bi-ctsicn.github.io/CBU/> for more information.
- Our Biomedical informatics core  provided investigators with expertise in clinical data management and analysis. Please go to <https://childrensnational.org/research-and-education/research-resources/biomedical-informatics> for more information.
